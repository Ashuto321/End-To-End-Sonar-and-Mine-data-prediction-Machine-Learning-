🔍 End-To-End Sonar and Mine Data Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Sonar vs Mine Data Classifier! 🪨⚓ This project uses machine learning to classify whether an object is a mine or a rock based on sonar signals. The entire ML pipeline is built from scratch — from data preprocessing to model deployment. 🚀
